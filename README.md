# NodeJS-Server
A simple Node.Js app for selling online travel guides. Integration with PayPal payments.

This project is unfinished, I'm still working on it. Some html file are unfinished and some part of the account management are missing.
The main reason is that I'm currently interested in developing the same functionalities on a microservice architecture pattern.
